## Background picture requirements

A reference to why it was very difficult to actually find good background pictures – there are quite some requirements when it comes to picking:

- It needs to be an exceptionally good photo of course – since when chosen, people will see it every day.
- We need to have a good balance of different motives, e.g. not too many landscape pics.
- Same for a good balance of different colors.
- The photo needs to work as a background. Photos with objects focused in the middle don’t really work as they will be overlapped by the widgets anyway.
- Especially the top part cannot have too much differing contrast, as then it’s not possible to see the navigation icons.
- We serve the pictures at 4k resolution and most of the selected images are also available in 6k or higher so it is future-proof.
- For the search of course we had to limit to CC0, CC By and CC By-Sa. Only CC0 would have been practically impossible cause there’s just not so many good ones which fit.
