Feature: app-theming

  Scenario: changing the color updates the header color
    Given I am logged in as the admin
    And I open the Admin settings
    And I open the "Theming" section
    And I see that the color selector in the Theming app has loaded
    And I see that the header color is "0082C9"
    When I set the "Color" parameter in the Theming app to "C9C9C9"
    Then I see that the parameters in the Theming app are eventually saved
    And I see that the header color is "C9C9C9"

  Scenario: resetting the color updates the header color
    Given I am logged in as the admin
    And I open the Admin settings
    And I open the "Theming" section
    And I see that the color selector in the Theming app has loaded
    And I set the "Color" parameter in the Theming app to "C9C9C9"
    And I see that the parameters in the Theming app are eventually saved
    And I see that the header color is "C9C9C9"
    When I reset the "Color" parameter in the Theming app to its default value
    Then I see that the parameters in the Theming app are eventually saved
    And I see that the header color is "0082C9"
