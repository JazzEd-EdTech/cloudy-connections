Thanks for reporting issues back to Nextcloud!

Note: This is the **issue tracker of Nextcloud**, please do NOT use this to get answers to your questions or get help for fixing your installation. This is a place to report bugs to developers, after your server has been debugged. You can find help debugging your system on our home user forums: https://help.nextcloud.com or, if you use Nextcloud in a large organization, ask our engineers on https://portal.nextcloud.com. See also  https://nextcloud.com/support for support options.

If you are a customer and are using Nextcloud Enterprise, please submit your issue directly in the Nextcloud Portal https://portal.nextcloud.com so it gets resolved more quickly by our dedicated engineers.

Note that Nextcloud is an open source project backed by Nextcloud GmbH. Most of our volunteers are home users and thus primarily care about issues that affect home users. Our paid engineers prioritize issues of our customers. If you are neither a home user nor a customer, consider paying somebody to fix your issue, do it yourself or become a customer.
